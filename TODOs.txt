testcases:
1. malformed requests
2. sequence/session number usage
3. shrinking inode entry
4. initializatin of file system
5. create the same file twice (with the same path) by the same user or different user
6. 

Parse:
1. path: 1) no / at the beginning; 2) 
2. read / write directory

File system:
1. when sending back, the logistics(cleartext, encryption, etc) compiled but not tested
2. double check session/sequence logic
3. Check sequence in session valid?
4. error checking, what if an user creates more than one session? Is it valid?
5. range of variable, which to use? uint32 or unsigned long or other? (where to check for sequence validity)
6. check if blocks are used up
7. PASSNAME ALREADY EXIST IN CREATE

AJC Modification on Jason's Code:
1. Process_create -- last several lines, when creating a new block, should create a array of direntries and set the first as new one instead of one?

Already tested:
1. testinit: create two-layer of directory, verified that when initialization, blocks are read in correctly, and deleted file should not be read in
2. test_overflow_dir: create overflow directory entries, delete one and then add new dir
3. test create: session wrong username, wrong password, username too long;
    create: wrong username, wrong password, user too long, other user using the session; invalid
